% With a minimal tuning to deal with in AIES algorithm, we are left with the problem of assessing convergence.
% In particular two key issues persists
% The previous discussion spoke rarely about the condition.
% It was demonstrated, through graphical representations the main idea of convergence in distributin.
% This section seeks to answer, the following two important questions of Markov chain 
% For an arbitrary starting distribution, when the chain can be considered stationary
% It is not to say that these initial part of the chain is not part of the target distribution support.
% They are, but as a distribution they are heavily biased.
% Assuming a stationary distribution have been reached, how long the chain should be run to meet certain level of accuracy
