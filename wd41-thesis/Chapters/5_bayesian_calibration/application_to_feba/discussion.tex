% Opening Paragraph, On Convergence
A series of \gls[hyper=false]{mcmc} simulations was conducted for each of the calibration schemes summarized in Table~\ref{tab:ch5_calibration_schemes}.
\marginpar{On the convergence of MCMC simulation}
Two thousands iterations and 1'000 walkers were used in the ensemble sampler generating 2'000'000 samples.
All simulations were started from the same initial parameters values: the nominal parameters values.
After post-processing the resulting posterior samples: discarding some of the initial iterations and thinning the samples,
(serially) independent sample size in the order of tens of thousands was obtained for each calibration scheme. 
Though the size of independent samples is much smaller than the initially obtained posterior samples, the resulting relative statistical error associated with model parameters estimates is in the order of less than $1\%$.
Based on the estimated autocorrelation time, before and after burn-in, no indication of lack of convergence during the ensemble iteration was found.
The autocorrelation time after burn-in was found to be smaller than total number of iterations (see Section~\ref{sub:bc_mcmc_thinning}). 

% On convergence and the length burn-in period
However, the results also supported the findings of \cite{Hou2012,Foreman-Mackey2013,Akeret2013} regarding the relatively long length of the burn-in period with respect to the total number of ensemble iterations in comparison with the length of the period in a single particle sample.
\marginpar{The length of burn-in period}
It is not uncommon to run a single particle \gls[hyper=false]{mcmc} simulation up to $100'000$ iterations (or beyond) for computer model calibration \cite{Wu2017,Wu2018}.
In such case, the length of burn-in period would be much smaller in comparison with the total number of iterations and thus would be less important to discard (a rule of thumb arguess for discarding at most $20\%$ of the total number of samples \cite{Sokal1997}).
On the contrary, in the case of ensemble sampler, although the total number of iterations are much smaller, the length of burn-in period was conservatively estimated between $40\%$ to $50\%$ of the total number of iterations\footnote{Note that although the number of iterations in an ensemble sampler is much smaller than in a single particle sampler, the computational cost would be relatively similar in terms of likelihood evaluations as multiple walkers mean that more computations have to be conducted per iteration.}.
Therefore, determining burn-in period was indeed more important;
if the samples associated with this initial transient were not discarded, it risked that the model parameters estimates would be heavily biased.

% On the Posterior samples, constraining power of data, and using different type of outputs
The resulting posterior samples, as presented in the corner plots (Figs.\ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_all_disc_centered}, \ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_tc_disc_centered}, \ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_dp_disc_centered}, \ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_co_disc_centered}, \ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_all_disc_centered_noparam8}, and \ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_all_nodisc}) and as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:ch5_post_param}, indicate different constraining ability of the data on the model parameters prior uncertainties depending on the calibration scheme.
Figs.~\ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_all_disc_centered}, \ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_tc_disc_centered}, \ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_dp_disc_centered}, and \ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_co_disc_centered} demonstrates the constraining ability of different types of data.
These calibration results are to be expected according to the sensitivity analysis conducted in Chapter~\ref{ch:gsa}.
For instance, the pressure drop output mainly sensitive to the parameter \texttt{iafbIntDr} can be mainly informed by the pressure drop data as indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_dp_disc_centered}.
Meanwhile, the liquid carryover output though sensitive to the variation of the model parameters \texttt{dffbVIHT} and \texttt{dffbIntDr} are overshadowed by the variation due to the boundary condition.
Thus, as indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_co_disc_centered} the constraining power of the liquid carryover data is fairly limited; the posterior uncertainties associated with the important parameters remain wide.

% TC Output
The results are similar when considering only clad temperature data for the calibration.
The parameters \texttt{gridHT} and \texttt{dffbWallHT} are well constrained by the temperature output data.
The parameter \texttt{gridHT}, in particular, is constrained only at the upper end of the uncertainty bound.
It turns out that decreasing the spacer grid heat enhancement below certain value will not decrease the overall heat transfer any longer.
Thus, below that certain value the enhancement is insensitive with respect to the clad temperature output.

% All Outputs
By definition, a model parameter that is not sensitive to a simulation output cannot be informed by the experimental data of that output. 
That is, the parameter is non-identifiable \cite{Hines2014}.  
And indeed, when considering all types of data, the prior uncertainties of the model parameters was shown to be simultaneously constrained and often even tighter (Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5_plot_ens_all_disc_centered}).

% No Constrain
There are, however, several parameters that simply cannot be constrained by the considered experimental data.
The uncertainties, especially the lower bounds, of the parameters \texttt{iafbWHT}, \texttt{dffbWDr} and \texttt{tQuench} remain close its initial lower uncertainty bound, while their upper bounds are only marginally smaller than that of the respective prior. 
These parameters are of marginal importance relative among the selected influential parameters.
Although it is straightforward to conclude that insensitive parameter cannot be constrained by the experimental data whatsoever, and the most influential ones can be strongly constrained, it stays unclear which among the parameters of intermediate importance as indicated by sensitivity measure of Chapter~\ref{ch:gsa} can be well constrained by the experimental data.

% On the Posterior samples, correlation structure On the Posterior samples, excluding dffbVIHTC

% On the Posterior samples, no bias

% On Uncertainty Propagation
A thousand samples of model parameters values were then taken from the respective pool of independent posterior samples for the purpose of uncertainty propagation on all the \gls[hyper=false]{feba} tests.
The uncertainty of additional parameters related to boundary conditions were also propagated alongside the posterior unceertainties of the model parameters.
For comparison purpose, uncertainty propagation was also conducted in which the correlation among model parameters are neglected (i.e., the model parameters were taken to be independent of each other).
In the following, the discussion is focused on the propagation of posterior uncertainties obtained from three calibration schemes, namely: \texttt{w/ Bias, All}, \texttt{w/o Bias}, and \texttt{w/ Bias, no dffbVIHT}

% On Uncertainty Propagation, Calibration vs. Informativeness

% On Uncertainty Propagation, TC1 FEBA Test 216 Different Calibration Schemes
The difference between the uncertainty propagation of the posterior uncertainties from the three calibration schemes can mainly be observed on two outputs $TC1$ (the clad temperature at the top of the assembly) and $CO$.
Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5_plot_feba_216_tc1_post} shows the uncertainty propagation results for the $TC1$ output.
The uncertainty band from the calibration scheme \texttt{w/ Bias, All} (and to a lesser extend the one from the scheme \texttt{w/ Bias, no dffbVIHT}) shows a consistent shape with the nominal \gls[hyper=false]{trace} prediction.
The band from the scheme \texttt{w/o Bias} is dramatically different (Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5_plot_feba_216_tc1_post_2}); it bears no resemblance whatsoever with the nominal \gls[hyper=false]{trace} prediction.
Moreover, the nominal \gls[hyper=false]{trace} prediction falls completely outside the uncertainty band.
As the predictions from the other axial elevations showed no such dramatic difference, and by comparing with the results of the scheme \texttt{w/ Bias, no dffbVIHT} it can be inferred that the parameter \texttt{dffbVIHT} is the one mainly responsible for this difference.

% Source of correlation
Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5_plot_feba_216_tc1_post} also illustrates that the posterior samples from the calibration scheme \texttt{w/ Bias, All} are indeed strongly correlated, ignoring the correlation changes significantly the resulting uncertainty bands of the prediction.
In other words, the model parameters only takes specific range of values in concert to reproduce the data.
In this illustration, the correlation among parameters tighten the uncertainty band while keeping the experimental data within it.
Moreover, as it was suspected, the parameter \texttt{dffbVIHT} is responsible for the strong correlation;
ignoring the correlation structure in the uncertainty propagation of the results from the scheme  \texttt{w/ Bias, no dffbVIHT} shows a marginal difference compared to the propagation with the correlation structure. 

% CO FEBA Test 216 Different Calibration Schemes
At the same time, allowing the parameter \texttt{dffbVIHT} to change dramatically from the initial nominal parameter value also allowed the calibration scheme \texttt{w/o Bias} to correct the bias in the prediction of liquid carryover as indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5_plot_feba_216_co_post_2}.
Now the nominal \gls[hyper=false]{trace} prediction mostly falls outside the posterior uncertainty band.
By construction, the other two schemes allowed the the nominal \gls[hyper=false]{trace} run to be within their respective posterior uncertainty bands although the bands did not (or only marginally) cover the experimental data.
As the calibration was conducted with respect to all other outputs of which many more data points were available this simply means that the agreement with respect to the other outputs offset the discrepancy of the liquid carryover.

% Connection with sensitivity analysis
This is further supported by the sensitivity analysis conducted in the previous chapter where it was shown that the parameter \texttt{dffbVIHT} became increasingly important at the top of the assembly and it was also found to be important for the $CO$ output.
Recall that the parameter \texttt{dffbVIHT} is responsible for the heat transfer between the vapor phase and the interface and it contributes to the variation in the available entrained liquid and droplets being carried away through the top of the assembly.
These droplets, in turn, is an important heat sink for the cladding.
Thus, an increase in the heat transfer coefficient enhances the heat transfer at the top of the assembly and accelerate the evaporation of the available droplets (thus the lower clad temperature) while simultaneously decreases the amount of liquid being carried away (thus the slower rate of liquid carryover collection).
