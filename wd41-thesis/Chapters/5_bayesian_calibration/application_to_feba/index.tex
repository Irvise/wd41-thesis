% Introductory paragraph
In this section, a Bayesian calibration on the \gls[hyper=false]{trace} reflood model parameters is conducted and assessed on the basis of the data from a test series of the \gls[hyper=false]{feba} reflood experiment.
Following the results of Chapter~\ref{ch:gsa}, only the $8$ important reflood model parameters are considered in the calibration while optionally taking into account the uncertainties in the $4$ parameters related to boundary condition.
Furthermore, following the development in Chapter~\ref{ch:gp_metamodel}, a \gls[hyper=false]{gp} metamodel is used to substitute code run for the \gls[hyper=false]{trace} model of \gls[hyper=false]{feba}.
There were $5$ experimental runs conducted in the test series that corresponded to different experimental boundary conditions.
The calibration is conducted solely on the test no. $216$, the base experimental run.
The calibration results are then assessed by means of propagating the resulting model parameters posterior uncertainties and comparing the predictions uncertainties for the other five experimental runs.
