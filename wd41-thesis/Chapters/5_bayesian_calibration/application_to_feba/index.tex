% Introductory paragraph
In this section, a Bayesian calibration on the parameters of the \gls[hyper=false]{trace} reflood model is conducted and assessed on the basis of the data from a test series of the \gls[hyper=false]{feba} reflood experiment.
Following the results of Chapter~\ref{ch:gsa}, only the $8$ most relevant reflood model parameters are considered in the calibration (while the uncertainties of the $4$ parameters related to boundary conditions are optionally taken into account).
Furthermore, following the developments in Chapter~\ref{ch:gp_metamodel}, a \gls[hyper=false]{gp} metamodel is used to substitute the code run of the \gls[hyper=false]{trace} model.
There were $5$ experimental runs conducted in the test series that corresponded to different experimental boundary conditions.
The calibration is conducted solely on test No. $216$, the base experimental run.
The calibration results are then assessed by means of propagating the resulting model parameters posterior uncertainties and comparing the prediction uncertainties with the data from the other five experimental runs.
