% Chapter 1
Chapter $1$ introduced the doctoral research.
The problem was acknowledged by the community through the recently concluded \gls[hyper=false]{premium} project; a benchmark project comparing different uncertainty 
In a way this doctoral research is a belated contribution

% Chapter 2
Chapter~\ref{ch:trace_reflood} presented the reflood experiment at the \glsentryshort{feba} facility that served as the experimental basis of this work.
The \gls[hyper=false]{trace} model of the facility was developed and a set of initial input parameters perceived to be important for the simulation was selected.
Thereafter, prior uncertainties of the selected input parameters were assigned.
Uncertainty propagation was conducted to assess the prior level of prediction uncertainties.
This model then became the running case study in the three subsequent chapters to which the proposed methods are applied.
