% Opening Paragraph
The main goal of the present doctoral research was to quantify the uncertainty of physical model parameters implemented in \gls[hyper=false]{th} system codes.
To that end, a methodology has been developed -- and its application demonstrated -- to quantify the uncertainty of physical model parameters important in the simulation of reflood experiment; relevant phenomena to consider in the safety analysis of \glspl[hyper=false]{lwr}.

The problem has been acknowledged and revisited in the recently concluded \gls[hyper=false]{premium} benchmark.

% What is this chapter all about
This final chapter starts with a chapter-wise summary of the thesis, presented in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions_chapterwise}.
The main achievements of the thesis are given in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions_achievements}, while recommendations for future work are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions_recommendations}.
The chapter -- and the thesis -- is finally concluded in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions_concluding_remarks}.
