\section{\glsentryshort{feba} Model in \glsentryshort{trace}}\label{sec:reflood_feba_trace}

The \gls{feba} facility was modeled using the TH system code \gls{trace}.
The model consists of a one-dimensional \textsc{VESSEL} component (to model the bundle test section),
a \textsc{PIPE} component (upper plenum of the test section), 
a \textsc{FILL} component (inlet flow and inlet temperature boundary conditions),
a \textsc{BREAK} component (outlet pressure boundary condition),
two \textsc{HTSTR} components (heater rods simulator and non-powered test section housing),
and a \textsc{POWER} components (imposed electrical boundary condition).

The \textsc{VESSEL} component was nodalized into $28$ hydraulic nodes of varying sizes between $60$ and $315$ $[mm]$.
Both \textsc{HTSTR} components were also nodalized into the sample number of coarse axial conduction nodes.
However, since a large axial temperature gradient is expected in a reflood transient,
the fine-mesh reflood flag in \gls{trace} was enabled.
As a result, each of the course conduction nodes is divided uniformly by $5$,
yielding a total of $142$ axial conduction nodes.
The main geometrical parameters and experimental conditions used to develop the \gls{trace} input model
are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:feba_trace},
and the nodalization of the model is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:feba_nodalization}.
