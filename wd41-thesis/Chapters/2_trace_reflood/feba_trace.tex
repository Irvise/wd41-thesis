% Introductory paragraph
The \gls[hyper=false]{feba} facility was modeled using the \gls[hyper=false]{th} system code \gls[hyper=false]{trace}.
The \gls[hyper=false]{trace} code used was a prototypical version developed, with the support of \gls[hyper=false]{usnrc}, for propagation of uncertainties.
The development was a branch from the reference code version \texttt{v5.0 Patch 3} \cite{USNRC2012}.
The model was developed based on specifications provided within the context of the \glsentryshort{premium} benchmark \cite{Skorek2013,Sanz2017},
following whenever possible the modeling best-practices guidelines for the \gls[hyper=false]{trace} code to minimize user effect \cite{USNRC2012a}.

% TRACE components involved
The model comprised the following \gls[hyper=false]{trace} components:
\marginpar{TRACE components}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A $1$-dimensional \texttt{VESSEL} component to model the bundle test section.
	\item A \texttt{PIPE} component to model the upper plenum of the test section.
	\item A \texttt{FILL} component to set the inlet flow and inlet temperature boundary conditions.
	\item A \texttt{BREAK} component to model the outlet pressure boundary condition.
	\item Two \texttt{HTSTR} components to model the heater rods simulator and non-powered test section housing.
	\item A \textsc{POWER} component to impose the electrical power boundary condition.
\end{itemize}

% Nodalization
The \texttt{VESSEL} component was nodalized into $28$ hydraulic nodes of varying sizes between $60$ and $315\,[mm]$.
\marginpar{Model nodalization}
Both \texttt{HTSTR} components were nodalized into the same number for the coarse axial conduction nodes.
However, since a large axial temperature gradient was expected in a reflood transient, the fine-mesh reflood flag in \gls[hyper=false]{trace} was enabled.
As a result, each of the coarse conduction nodes was divided uniformly in five, yielding a total of $142$ axial conduction nodes.

The main geometrical parameters and experimental conditions used to develop the \gls[hyper=false]{trace} input model are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:feba_trace}, and the nodalization of the model is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch2_feba_nodalization}.
