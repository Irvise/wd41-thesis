\section{Thermal-Hydraulics System Code \glsentryshort{trace}}\label{sec:reflood_trace}

\gls{trace} is the best-estimate system \gls{th} code developed by the \gls{usnrc} 
as a tool for light water reactor transient analysis during normal and accident scenarios.
Its development is an on-going effort 
to modernize into a single software package all previous \gls{usnrc} \gls{th} codes
that were developed separately for specific reactor types and/or applications.
This ultimately would make the code more versatile for end users and more efficient to maintain for the developer.

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial [(1-\alpha)\rho_l]}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot [(1-\alpha \rho_l \mathbf{v_l}] = - \Gamma
\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
