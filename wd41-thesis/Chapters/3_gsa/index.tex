% Linking Paragraph
As mentioned in the introduction, describing and understanding properly the impact of model parameters variations on the model prediction are an essential part of the model development and assessment. 
This chapter presents the application of global and statistical \gls[hyper=false]{sa} to analyze the \gls[hyper=false]{feba} model in \gls[hyper=false]{trace} in order to investigate the effects of the input parameter variations.

% Focus
After first introducing in Section~\ref{sec:sa_statistical_framework} the notational convention used in the present chapter,
the proposed methodology is presented.
The methodology leverages various developments in global \gls[hyper=false]{sa} and \glsfirst[hyper=false]{fda} methods and follows three key underlying ideas.

% Overview
The first idea, presented in Section~\ref{sec:sa_time_dependent_variation}, is to reduce the dimensionality of the output space while preserving the interpretability of the results by utilizing techniques derived from \gls[hyper=false]{fda} \cite{Ramsay2005}.
Section~\ref{sec:sa_parameters_screening} introduces the second idea, which is to reduce the dimensionality of the input parameter space through screening analysis using the Morris method \cite{Morris1991,Campolongo2011}. 
The third and final idea is to investigate, quantitatively and in more detail, the effect of variation of parameters on the overall time-dependent output variation. 
This is done through variance-based SA using the Sobolâ€™-Saltelli
method \cite{Sobol2001, Saltelli2002}, which is presented in Section~\ref{sec:sa_variance_decomposition}.

The methods are then applied to analyze the \gls[hyper=false]{feba} model in \gls[hyper=false]{trace} to understand better its inputs/outputs relationship under the assumed uncertainty on its input parameters.
The results are presented and discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sa_application_to_feba}.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:sa_chapter_summary} closes the chapter with a summary.
