%***************************************************************************************************************************************************

As mentioned in the introduction, describing and understanding properly the impact of model parameters variations on the model prediction are an essential part of model development and assessment. 
This chapter deals with the application of global and statistical sensitivity analysis to analyze the FEBA model in TRACE in order to investigate the effect of variation of model parameters across their range of variation.

After first presenting the notational convention used in the present chapter in Section~\ref{sec:sa_statistical_framework},
the proposed methodology is presented.
The methodology leverages various developments in global SA and FDA methods and follows three key underlying ideas.

The first idea, presented in Section~\ref{sec:sa_time_dependent_variation}, is to reduce the dimensionality of the output space while keeping interpretability of the results by utilizing techniques derived from Functional Data Analysis (FDA) \cite{Ramsay2005}.
Section~\ref{sec:sa_parameters_screening} introduces the second idea, that is to reduce the dimensionality of the input parameter space through screening analysis using the Morris method \cite{Morris1991,Campolongo2011}. 
The third and final idea is to investigate, quantitatively and in more detail, the effect of variation of parameters across their range of variation on the overall time-dependent output variation. 
This is done through variance-based SA using the Sobolâ€™-Saltelli
method \cite{Sobol2001, Saltelli2002} which is presented in Section~\ref{sec:sa_variance_decomposition}.

The methods are then applied to analyze the FEBA model in TRACE to understand better its inputs/outputs relationship under the imposed parameteric uncertainty.
The results are presented and discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sa_application_to_feba}.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:sa_chapter_summary} closes the chapter with a summary.
