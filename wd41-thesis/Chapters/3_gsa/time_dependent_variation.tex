\section{Describing Variation of Time-Dependent Output}\label{sec:sa_time_dependent_variation}

Ramsay and Silverman \cite{Ramsay2005} popularized \gls{fda}, which refers to statistical analyses of data that are functions.
The main assumption of \gls{fda}, as opposed to a more conventional multivariate analysis, is that data present sufficient smoothness, defined by existence of derivatives up to a certain order.
Another distinguishing feature of \gls{fda}, as opposed to time-series analysis or spatial statistics, is the availability of numerous replications of such data (i.e., set of functions) produced by the same or similar underlying process. 
The goal of \gls{fda} related to this work is to describe the overall variation of a set of functions using a smaller set of scalars.
These scalars, in turn, can be used as the \gls{qoi} for \gls{sa}.

Separation of phase variation from magnitude variation by registration procedure allows for the definition of a proper mean function.
With respect to that, the notion of functional variation can be defined.
The covariance function of a set of function realizations $\{y_n(t);n = 1, 2, \cdots, N; t \in [t_a,t_b]\}$ from a random process $Y$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\nu (t_1, t_2) \equiv \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_n(t_1) - \bar{y}(t_1)) \cdot (y_n(t_2) - \bar{y}(t_2))
\label{eq:covariance_function}
\end{equation}

To extract more meaningful information from the covariance function, the function is often projected onto lower-dimensional space using an orthogonal decomposition.
This projection can be done through the functional principal component (fPC) analysis (fPCA) (also know as the Karhunen-Lo\'eve transform):
\begin{equation}
	\nu (t_1, t_2) = \sum_{j=1}^{+\infty} \rho_j \cdot \xi_j(t_1) \cdot \xi_j(t_2)
\label{eq:kl_transform}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_j$ is a series of ordered eigenvalues of decreasing values; 
$\xi_j(t)$ is the corresponding series of orthogonal eigenfunctions (or the fPC).
