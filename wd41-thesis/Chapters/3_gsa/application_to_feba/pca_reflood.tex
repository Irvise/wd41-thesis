\subsection{Principal Components of the Reflood Curve}\label{sub:sa_application_pca_reflood}
%*******************************************************************************************

% Introductory paragraph
The time-dependent cladding temperature, pressure drop, and liquid carryover were decomposed in their respective functional principal components (\glspl[hyper=false]{fpc}) to better quantify the mode of variations of the whole time-dependent curves.
Therefore, the variance decomposition was also carried out on the \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} scores associated with the \glspl[hyper=false]{fpc}.
\marginpar{Explained variance}
Because each \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} is associated with a particular mode of variation over the whole transient,
it parsimoniously describes the overall variation of the time-dependent curve in a smaller set of numbers.
The \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} analysis of all the time-dependent curves for each type of output showed that the first two respective \glspl[hyper=false]{fpc} account for more than $85\%$ of the overall functional variations (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_explained_variance}).

% 1st fPC of the mid-assembly clad temperature
The first \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} of the (registered) cladding temperature at the mid-height of the assembly (in the reflood transient) and the effect of its perturbation around the mean function are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_pc1_tc4}.
\marginpar{1\textsuperscript{st} \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} of the (registered) mid-height cladding temperature transient}
The \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_pc1_tc4_fpc} was obtained by multiplying the eigenfunction $\xi_j(t)$ with the square root of the respective eigenvalue, i.e., $fPC_j = \sqrt{\rho_j} \times \xi_j(t)$.
As the eigenfunction only represents the shape (mode) of function variation,
this multiplication was done to give it a sense of scale with respect to the cladding temperature variation (as $\sqrt{\rho_j}$ represents the standard deviation of the mode $j$).
The perturbation around the mean function (Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_pc1_tc4_perturbation}) is done by adding to and subtracting from the mean function,
the eigenfunction multiplied by twice the corresponding score standard deviation $\sqrt{\rho_j}$, i.e., $\bar{y}(t) \pm 2 \times \sqrt{\rho_j} \times \xi_j(t)$.

This particular \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} corresponds to a mode of variation that relates to the amplitude of the temperature reversal period (see Section~\ref{sec:reflood_phenomenology}).
This is the strongest mode of variation, accounting for $55\%$ of the overall cladding temperature variation.

% 2nd fPC of the mid-assembly clad temperature
Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_pc2_tc4} shows the results for the second \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} of the (registered) mid-height cladding temperature transient and the effect of its perturbation on the mean function.
\marginpar{2\textsuperscript{nd} \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} of the (registered) mid-height cladding temperature transient}
This mode relates to the variation in the temperature descent after reaching the maximum temperature, prior to quenching.
Visibly, some realizations tend to bring about more convexity in the temperature descent than others.
This mode of variation constitutes $30\%$ of the overall variation.

% 1st fPC of the mid-assembly clad temperature warping function
The previous \glspl[hyper=false]{fpc} were carried on the registered
\marginpar{1\textsuperscript{st} \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} of the warping function for the mid-height cladding temperature transient}
cladding temperature transient where the phase variations in the data set have been removed.
It is also interesting to see the phase variations in the data set separately.
This can be done by carrying out the same procedure on the resulting warping functions associated with each clad temperature realization.
Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_pc1_tc4_warp} shows the 1st \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} and the effect of its perturbation on the mean function.
The mode corresponds to the overall shift in the timing of the two landmarks compared to the mean function. 
From the figure, a delay in the maximum temperature tends also to result in a delay in the time of quenching, and vice versa.
However, the variation in the time of the maximum temperature tends to be much smaller than the variation in the time of quenching.

% 1st fPC of the mid-assembly pressure drop
The first \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} of the pressure drop transient curves at the middle of the assembly is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_pc1_dpmid}.
\marginpar{1\textsuperscript{st} \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} of the pressure drop transient at the middle of the assembly}
The \gls[hyper=false]{fpc}, taking into account $77\%$ of the output variation, is mostly responsible for the variation during the pressure drop rise, where the channel segment is continuously quenched from the bottom.
That is, some realizations rise more quickly (or more slowly) in reaching the equilibrium pressure drop.

% 1st fPC of the liquid carryover
The first \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} of the liquid carryover transient curves, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_pc1_co}, are straightforward to interpret.
\marginpar{1\textsuperscript{st} \gls[hyper=false]{fpc} of the liquid carryover transient}
The \gls[hyper=false]{fpc}, taking into account $93\%$ of the output variation, is the linear change of the average liquid carryover during the transient.
In other words, the perturbation on the liquid carryover is accumulated linearly over time.
