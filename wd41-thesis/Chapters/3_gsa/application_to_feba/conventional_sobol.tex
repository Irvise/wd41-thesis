% Maximum temperature as QoI
As explained in before, two conventional \gls[hyper=false]{qoi} to characterize a reflood curve are the maximum clad temperature and the time of quenching.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_sobol_boxplot_tc4_maxtemp} the variation of the maximum mid-height clad temperature (with standard deviation of $59.7\,[K]$) was driven mainly by four model parameters,
contributing up to $77\%$ of the total output variation.
One influential parameter is related to the spacer grid HT enhancement model and the three others are related to the \gls[hyper=false]{dffb}-regime model parameters (with the combined effect of $63\%$).
Moreover since the sum of all the main-effect indices was relatively close to $1.0$, the parameters were not interacting with respect to this particular \gls[hyper=false]{qoi}.

% Time of Quenching as QoI
The parameter sensitivity with respect to the time of quenching gave a different picture as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_sobol_boxplot_tc4_quenchtime}.
The variation in the time of quenching (with standard deviation of $59.9\,[s]$) was driven mainly by the spacer grid HT enhancement parameter model (with contribution close to $50\%$  of the total output variation).
The \gls[hyper=false]{dffb}-related parameters are next in line with contribution of about $\sim18\%$, while each of the other parameters contributes to less than $10\%$ of the total output variation.
Similar to the case of the maximum clad temperature as the \gls[hyper=false]{qoi}, no strong interaction effects were observed.

% Time-dependent sensitivity indices
To better understand how the output sensitivity to the model parameters is changing over the course of the reflood transient, 
the clad temperature at the middle of the assembly at each time step was taken as the \gls[hyper=false]{qoi} and the main-effect indices were calculated.
This resulted in a set of sensitivity indices at each time with respect to the clad temperature as presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_si_evol}.
Note that the indices presented in the figure correspond to the reflood curves in which the phase variations between realizations were removed through the registration procedure.

% "1st" part of the transient
The top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_si_evol} shows how the relative importance of the parameters and their interactions in a dynamic model change with time.
With respect to the clad temperature, up to $120\,[s]$, the model parameters were non-interacting as indicated by the sum of the main-effect indices that was close to $1.0$.
The spacer HT enhancement and \gls[hyper=false]{dffb}-related model parameters were found to be the most important in this time period.

% "2nd" part of the transient
However, from $120\,[s]$ onward, stronger parameter interactions took place, as indicated by the decreasing the sum of the main-effect indices with at its minimum only explained well below $20\%$ of the total output variation.
Furthermore, some other parameters also become more prominent at a later stage of the transient.
The quench temperature, which for the most part of the transient was non-influential started to top after $200\,[s]$.
At $\sim300\,[s]$, the temperature transient variations suddenly were driven only by parameter interactions.
Finally, the variation of the pressure boundary condition accounted for most of the temperature variance at the end of the transient. 

% Putting the dynamic into context
To put the dynamic behavior of the sensitivity indices in context, the temperature variation is also given for each time step in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_si_evol}.
Note that in the plot, the last part of the transient (where the pressure boundary condition becomes visibly important) amounts to $2\,[K]$, a hardly relevant magnitude in the current context.
After quenching, the wall temperature is essentially commensurate with the coolant temperature.
The small temperature variation, in turn, corresponds to the change in the saturation temperature at the outlet due to variation in the pressure boundary condition.

% Note on the imperfection of registration
The figure also shows some sign of imperfection in the registration procedure.
The sudden jump of variation around the time of quenching can be attributed to a residual misalignment that still exists in the registered dataset.
As the landmark registration is supposed to remove the phase variation with respect to time of quenching (one of the landmarks),
temperature variation of this magnitude at the particular time should not have been observed.

% Closing paragraph
The numerical results of the Sobol' indices estimates presented above for each parameter with respect to these two outputs are tabulated in \ref{tab:app_sobol_tc4_maxtemp} and Table~\ref{tab:app_sobol_tc4_quenchtime} in Appendix~\ref{app:tbl_results_sobol}.
