\subsection{Convergence of the Sobol' Indices}\label{sub:sa_application_convergence_sobol}

% TRACE plot of total effect indices estimation
The convergence of the Sobol' indices' estimator can be investigated from their evolutions as functions of increasing number of samples.
Shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_running_indices} is the evolution (trace plot) of the estimated main-effect indices with the maximum cladding temperature as the \gls[hyper=false]{qoi}.
The Saltelli et al. estimator performs poorly compared to the Janon et al. estimator for this particular output.
This means that a larger number of samples are required to obtain a stable ranking.

% Uncertainty in the estimation
If the main purpose of the \gls[hyper=false]{sa} is simply to rank the parameter importance with respect to a particular \gls[hyper=false]{qoi} (as before),
then the Janon et al. estimator visibly requires fewer samples and the ranking can be reliably constructed.
However, the apparent stabilization of the indices' estimator is not sufficient to establish a robust quantitative estimate of the indices since \gls[hyper=false]{mc} estimation entails sampling uncertainty due to finite number of samples.
Such uncertainty needs to be addressed and reported for all the indices estimates.

% Empirical convergence study
In this work, an empirical convergence study was established using three different sample sizes ($250$; $500$; $1000$),
and for each size, the $95\%$ \gls[hyper=false]{ci} length (the difference between the upper bound and lower bound) using the bootstrap technique\cite{Efron1986} using $10000$ replications.
The results are shown if Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_convergence_maxtemp} for the maximum cladding temperature as the \gls[hyper=false]{qoi}.
Note that the comparisons between \gls[hyper=false]{ci} lengths of different estimates can be made directly as the Sobol' index itself is dimensionless.
As can be seen, with respect to this \gls[hyper=false]{qoi}, the Janon et al. estimator is further confirmed as the more efficient estimator.
The uncertainty of indices estimated by the Saltelli et al. estimator is still high for numbers of samples in the range of thousands.
Also, the efficiency of the Saltelli et al. estimator is also found to be more sensitive to the choice of estimand (i.e., Sobol' index of a given parameter).

% Difference in output results in different convergence
However, further investigation also revealed that the efficiency of an estimator depended on the \gls[hyper=false]{qoi} in a more complex manner than initially considered.
As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_convergence_pc1score}, where the first principal component scores were taken as the \gls[hyper=false]{qoi}, both estimators were found to be comparable,
with the Saltelli et al. estimator being even slightly more efficient.
And as before, the Janon et al. estimator shows less sensitivity to the choice of estimand in its convergence as compared to the Saltelli et al. estimator.

% The use of convergence study
The convergence analysis plots shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:ch3_plot_convergence_maxtemp} and \ref{fig:ch3_plot_convergence_pc1score} can be useful in the planning of the simulation experiments.
As can be inferred from both figures, the \gls[hyper=false]{ci} length of a given estimator depends on the \gls[hyper=false]{qoi}, the estimand, the estimator used, and the number of samples.
The regression lines also indicate the projection of reduction in the \gls[hyper=false]{ci} length.

% Total-effect Indices convergence
As for the total-effect indices, the results obtained using the Jansen's estimator confirmed the good efficiency of the estimator,
reaching below $10\%$ \gls[hyper=false]{ci} length for $1000$ \gls[hyper=false]{mc} samples across all \gls[hyper=false]{qoi}.
Benefiting from the screening procedure taken before ($12$ influential parameters instead of $27$ parameters) and considering the empirical convergence,
a total of $2000$ samples (which corresponds to $28000$ \gls[hyper=false]{trace} runs) was deemed appropriate for the more detailed \gls[hyper=false]{sa} presented below.
