	``All models are wrong but some are useful''
\end{quote}
The quote by Box perhaps succinctly describes.

% Overview of the chapter
This opening chapter intends to introduce briefly the importance, the use and the challenges of using system code in simulating \gls[hyper=false]{th} behavior of \gls[hyper=false]{npp} in the context of its safety analysis.
Section~\ref{sec:intro_computer_simulation} starts with basic definitions of relevant terms used throughout the thesis before moving on to a brief introduction to safety analysis and thermal-hydraulics system code.
Uncertainty analysis of \gls[hyper=false]{th} system code is first discussed in Section~\ref{sec:intro_uncertainty_quantification}.

% Objectives, Scope, and Statistical Framework
After outlining the background and the context of the present doctoral research, Section~\ref{sec:intro_objectives_and_scope} then describes the statement of the problem, the objectives, and the scope of the research.
This thesis proposed a methodology comprises of sequential steps to analyze a computer model (i.e., \gls[hyper=false]{th} system code) with the overall goal of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the model parameters based on experimental data.
It consolidates and adapts recent developments of in the applied statistics literature.
In relation to that, Section~\ref{sec:intro_statistical_framework} provides a broad, and by no means exhaustive, overview of the research landscape on each of the proposed steps.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:intro_thesis_structure} concludes the chapter by outlining the structure of the thesis.
