\section{Computer Simulation and Safety Analysis of Nuclear Power Plant}\label{sec:intro_computer_simulation}

The ubiquity of computer simulation applications in many fields of science and engineering results in an even more pervasive definitions of the term \textit{scientific computer simulation} itself 
and other associated terms such as \textit{model} and \textit{simulation}.
Though most of the definitions in the literature are not necessarily in contradiction to each other, 
to avoid confusion, this thesis adopts a recent definition proposed by Kaizer et al.\cite{Kaizer2015} quoted below,

\begin{quote}
	Scientific Computer Simulation is the imitation of a behavior of a system, entity, phenomenon, or process in the physical universe using limited mathematical concepts, symbols, and relations through the exercise or use of scientific computer model.
