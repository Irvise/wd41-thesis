% Introductory Paragraph
Before continuing the discussion of uncertainty analysis of code predictions, it will be worthwhile to define some additional terminologies to avoid later confusion.

In making a connection with the notion of \emph{simulator} introduced in Section~\ref{sec:intro_computer_simulation}, 
recall that from Fig.~\ref{fig:ch1_th_system_code} an \emph{input deck} is distinct from the code itself.
Fig.~\ref{fig:ch1_simulator_io} depicts the notion of simulator of a thermal-hydraulics system in a more generic way, as an input/output model.
\begin{figure}[bth]

\end{figure}

Indeed input deck defines specific problem (i.e., system) of interest.
It includes the specifications for geometrical configuration (i.e., the nodalization), choice of material and fluid involves, as well as initial and boundary conditions.
It may also include the setting for the numerical solver.
Some of those specifications (such as the boundary conditions, etc.) are parametrized and constitutes \emph{controllable inputs} denoted by $\bm{x}_c$\footnote{later on, \emph{controllable} inputs corresponds to the equivalent parameters in a physical experiment which can be controlled by the experimentalist.}.
The conservation equations of the code are closed with additional set of closure laws (and other sub-models) $\mathcal{M}_i(\bm{x}_c, \bm{x}_m, \bm{u})$.
These closure laws are, in turn, parametrized with a set of model specific parameters denoted by $\bm{x}_m$ which is referred to as the \emph{physical model parameters}.
 
Specifying the input deck, as far as user is concerned, completely defines the problem and the code will solve the conservation equations which output the dynamic state of relevant physical variables $\mathbf{u}(\bm{r}, t)$ (e.g., fluid pressure, temperature, wall temperature, etc.).
In practice, these raw simulation outputs are further post-processed to obtain the so-called \glspl[hyper=false]{qoi} the are relevant to the problem at hand.

\subsection{Forward Uncertainty Quantification}\label{sub:intro_uq_forward}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

% Best-estimate, limitation
As explained, best-estimate analysis uses more realistic modeling assumptions for analyzing transient behavior of \gls[hyper=false]{npp}.
It attempts as realistically as possible to describe the behavior of the relevant physical processes occur during the plant transient.
And yet, even the best available understanding of the physical process is still limited.
Understanding of complex phenomena might not yet adequate and data support for some processes can be very limited.s
Simplifying assumptions, approximations, and expert judgments to some degree are unavoidable and still required to have a complete analysis.

% Best-estimate, plus uncertainty
Hence, best-estimate analysis has to be complemented with uncertainty analysis.
\marginpar{Best-estimate plus uncertainty}
The ultimate goal of uncertainty analysis is to associate code prediction with its uncertainty.
These combined quantities are then compared with certain regulator safety limits (e.g., \gls[hyper=false]{pct}) to check whether the limits still fall outside the uncertainty band of the code prediction.

% Source of possible uncertainties
There are several known sources of uncertainty that render the prediction on $\bm{u}(\mathbf{r},t)$ and its derived quantities uncertain.
The following are the sources of primary interest in the present research:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 1 
  \item 2
  \item 3
\end{enumerate}

% Forward uncertainty quantification, Inputs as random variables
In statistical uncertainty analysis, the controllable inputs and physical model parameters are modeled as random variables ($\bm{\mathcal{X}}_c$ and $\bm{\mathcal{X}}_m$, respectively) equipped with probability distributions.
\marginpar{Forward uncertainty quantification}
Then using \gls[hyper=false]{mc} technique, samples are generated from their respective distributions and they are used to run the code multiple times.
Finally, statistics of code outputs (raw or post-processed), are summarized to obtain the uncertainty measure of the prediction.
In other words, the uncertainties in the controllable inputs and physical model parameters are \emph{propagated forward} through the code to quantify the uncertainty of the predictions as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch1_simulator_uq_forward}.
The practice of propagating uncertainty by \gls[hyper=false]{mc} is widely accepted in the nuclear engineering thermal-hydraulics community \cite{Lellouche1990,Glaeser1994,Glaeser2008}.

% Source of uncertainty, initial and boundary condition

% Source of uncertainty, physical model parameters

% Model parameters
The physical model parameters, however, are conceptually different.
\marginpar{Model parameters}
The physical models referred to in this thesis are usually represented either in the form of correlation or phenomenological (mechanistic) model.
The parameters associated with these models are derived from experimental data.
They can either represent physically meaningful quantities (e.g., reaction rate coefficient) or not (i.e., a tuning parameter).
In either way, there are uncertainties associated with these parameters especially as the conditions of their intended use is making prediction can be (at times, very) different than the conditions of their derivation.
The conceptual distinction related to model parameters will be revisited in Chapter~\ref{ch:bayesian_calibration}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Inverse Uncertainty Quantification}\label{sub:intro_uq_inverse}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

% Introductory paragraph, motivation
The physical model parameters often cannot be measured directly.
In this situation, in order to estimate their values,
experiments with well-specified conditions are carried out and correlations (models) are fitted based on the experimental data. 
Recall that from the discussion of closure laws origin in Section~\ref{sub:intro_th_system_code},
this can also apply to phenomenological models where free parameters are allowed to be tuned according to match the experimental data.
Ultimately, the optimal value of the estimated parameter is implemented in the code.
As the code is used to simulate multiple phenomena during a transient, additional experiments are carried out in larger, more complex test facilities.
Finally, based on the data obtained, the models can be validated.

% Inverse uncertainty
To obtain the uncertainty associated with the model parameters obtained in the manner above, the problem can be posed as an inverse problem.
In this setting, given a set of experimental data $\{\mathbf{D}\}$ with a known controllable inputs $\mathbf{x}_c$, the task is then to infer the value of the physical model parameters.
It is important to acknowledge various sources of uncertainty previously mentioned:
experimental data and controllable inputs are observed but perhaps there remains residual uncertainty and observation error associated with them;
and the associated models are also only an approximation of the real physical processes with a possible, but unknown, systematic bias.

% Connection to PREMIUM Benchmark
The importance of characterizing the uncertainty in the physical models parameters was acknowledged by the \gls[hyper=false]{wgama} of the \gls[hyper=false]{oecd}/\gls[hyper=false]{nea}.
This led to the \gls[hyper=false]{premium} project.
Its main goal is to report the state-of-the-art of the available methodologies to quantify the uncertainty in the physical models parameters.
The following will briefly describe the project and highlight its main findings.

\subsection{OECD/NEA PREMIUM project}\label{sub:intro_premium}
%-------------------------------------------------------------

% Introductory paragraph
The \gls[hyper=false]{premium} project was an activity launched by the \gls[hyper=false]{oecd}/\gls[hyper=false]{nea} in $2012$ and concluded in $2016$ with the aim to advance the methods for quantifying the uncertainties associated with the physical model parameters in \gls[hyper=false]{th} system codes.
It was the continuation of the previous project \gls[hyper=false]{bemuse}, which concetrated on the propagation and sensitivity analysis of the input uncertainties in large scale simulation (large break \gls[hyper=false]{loca}).
The main finding of \gls[hyper=false]{bemuse} can be found in \cite{Perez2011}.
The emphasis of the \gls[hyper=false]{premium} benchmark was placed on the derivation of the model parameters uncertainty and their validation.
