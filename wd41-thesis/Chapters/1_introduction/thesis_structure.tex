\section{Structure of the Thesis}\label{sec:intro_thesis_structure}
%------------------------------------------------------------------

This doctoral thesis is organized into six chapters.
The description and the application on a thermal-hydraulics simulation of the three statistical approaches introduced in the previous section, preceded by brief review on the selected physical models, constitute the main chapters of the present thesis (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ch1_methodological_roadmap}).
They are bookended by an introductory chapter (this chapter) and a concluding chapter.

\textsc{Chapter~\ref{ch:trace_reflood}} gives an overview of the system thermal-hydraulics code \gls[hyper=false]{trace} with an emphasis on its reflood phenomena modeling and simulation.
The chapter also introduces the reflood experiment at the \gls[hyper=false]{feba} facility which serves as the experimental basis of this work followed by its modeling in \gls[hyper=false]{trace} code.
This model becomes the running case study in the three subsequent chapters to which the proposed methods are applied.
The chapter includes the selection of initial parameters relevant for reflood simulation and the propagation of their uncertainties on the code prediction.

\textsc{Chapter~\ref{ch:gsa}} introduces the \gls[hyper=false]{gsa} analysis methods adopted in this thesis with three key underlying ideas.
The first is to reduce the dimensionality of the code output space.
As the output of the simulation is time-dependent, dimension reduction is carried out while trying to preserve the interpretability of the results.
The second idea is to reduce the dimensionality of the input parameters space through parameter screening.
The third and final idea is to investigate, quantitatively, the effect of variation of parameters on the overall time-dependent output variation through variance decomposition.
The presented methods are then applied to the \gls[hyper=false]{trace} model of \gls[hyper=false]{feba} and the results are discussed. 

\textsc{Chapter~\ref{ch:gp_metamodel}} presents the method for model approximation adopted in this thesis.
