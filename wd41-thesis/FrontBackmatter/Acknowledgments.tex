% Opening Paragraph
This doctoral research has been conducted in the framework of the \glsentryshort{stars} project in the Laboratory for Reactor Physics and Systems Behavior (LRS)\footnote{which by the time this thesis is printed will cease to exist, and perhaps metamorphosize to a better form...} at the \glsfirst[hyper=false]{psi}.
Although most of the funding was provided by the sister's laboratory of the same name at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne (EPFL), the work was mainly carried out at \gls[hyper=false]{psi}.
Besides providing me with a comfortable working place, \glsentryshort{psi} through \glsentryshort{stars} project also kindly financed all the business trips taken during the course of the doctoral research, including NUTHOS-10 in Okinawa, NURETH-16 in Chicago, SAMO 2016 in Capri, NUTHOS-11 in Gyeongju, as well as several trips to the OECD/NEA office in Paris.

It is my cultural reflex to readily admit that any successful work is a collective effort, sometimes with God thrown into the mix;
while any eventual shortage is to be credited to me and me alone.
This is especially true for this work which at times, if not most of the times, felt really difficult to carry out.
So I am truly grateful for the support and contributions of so many people such that this work can be completed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Prof. Andreas Pautz, the thesis director, for giving me the opportunity to conduct this research and to extend, again and again, my stay in Switzerland.
	I appreciate his support all these years and wish him all the best navigating the Nuclear Energy and Safety Division of \gls[hyper=false]{psi} in an evermore turbulent times.
	\item Mr. Omar Zerkak and Dr. Gregory Perret. And there were two; these two people have invested in me so much of their time, knowledge, and patience that allow me to start and finish the thesis.
	I am truly grateful for those, especially when the thesis was becoming harder and harder to finish and I was on the verge failing.
	\item Mr. Philippe Jacquemoud, in his word an IT ``all-rounder'' who has been truly helpful providing me with technical supports, but perhaps most importantly, by being a good friend.
	\item Dr. Mathieu Hursin and Dr. Dimitri Rochman, who appeared genuinely interested in my work and gave during these period, invaluable comments.
	\item Mr. Hakim Ferroukhi
	\item Dr. Ivor Clifford
	\item the people of 
	\item the people of STARS
	\item Mrs. Ruth Ringele
	\item Friends
\end{itemize}
