# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com)
and this project adapted [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) for versioning.
Because we are dealing with a document, the versioning has to be adapted:

1. Major version zero (0.y.z) is document template preparation phase.
   The document might still contain `lorem ipsum` scattered around.
2. Major version 1.0.0 is the document template is ready to be populated
3. Patch version (x.y.Z) is incremented when a subsection is finished
4. Minor version (x.Y.z) is incremented when a section is finished
5. Major version (X.y.z) is incremented when a chapter is finished
6. Pre-release version tag is used to denote review process. 
   It is used only in minor and major version releases. 
   Finishing a subsection does not warrant a review yet.
   The tag used is `-<initial>.<iteration>`, so for example `1.5.0-ZO40.1` 
   for first iteration on the 5th finished section of major release 1.
