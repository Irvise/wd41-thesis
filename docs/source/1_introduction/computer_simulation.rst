Scientific Computer Simulation
------------------------------

.. A definition

The ubiquity of computer simulation in science and engineering has resulted in numerous definitions of the term *scientific computer simulation*, *model*, and *simulation*.
To avoid confusion, this thesis adopts a recent definition proposed by Kaizer et al.Kaizer2015 quoted below:

.. epigraph::

   Scientific Computer Simulation is the imitation of a behavior of a system, entity, phenomenon, or process in the physical universe 
   using limited mathematical concepts, symbols, and relations through the exercise or use of scientific computer model.
	
.. The definition, explained

This definition highlights three main points.
First, this definition accentuates the difference between *model* and *simulation*.
A model deals with the notion of representation of a system, while a simulation deals with the notion of imitation of a behavior of that system.
Secondly, a model is said to be scientific when it represents a real world system as its subject.
Finally, the modifier *computer* generally implies that the mathematical models cannot be solved analytically and their solutions require a computer.
Because the associated numerical approximations can affect its solution, many computational-related aspects often need to be considered.
This thesis only deals with computer simulation.
